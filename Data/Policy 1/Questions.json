Since {Dark Magician} has the most ATK, it becomes unaffected by spell cards due to {Pole Position}'s effect. Now, {Dark Magician Girl} has the most ATK, so it becomes unaffected by spell cards due to {Pole Position}'s effect, and {Dark Magician} once again becomes affected by spell cards. Then, {Dark Magician} becomes unaffected once again. The players correctly identify this as an infinite loop, and you get called to the table. How do you resolve the call.",

This is so that a player cannot be locked out of taking an action (sometimes even actions required by the game, such as drawing during your draw phase). To solve the infinite loop, the card most at fault should be determined, and then send to the GY. In this case, that is {Pole Position}."

To solve the infinite loop, the card most at fault should be determined, and then send to the GY.
