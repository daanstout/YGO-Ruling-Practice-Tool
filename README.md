# YGO-Ruling-Practice-Tool

This is a tool I made to practice Yu-Gi-Oh rulings with. It is currently still a work in progress, but it is functional in its current state.

## Running the Practice Tool

Running the practice tool can be done by simply downloading the zip file and unpacking it. Unfortunately, due to it not being signed (as that is expensive), it will probably be flagged by anti-virus software. In order to run it, it will have to be whitelisted.

Alternatively, you can also download [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/4.4.1-stable/Godot_v4.4.1-stable_mono_win64.zip), download the source code from here (this is also included in the release, but not within the actual zip file), and open the folder with Godot. Then, you should be able to run the program by pressing the play button in the top right. You might need to download the [.Net 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) to be able to run it.
